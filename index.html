                If you are on vacation in Maine, you’re one step closer to
                living the way life should be. If you’ve already moved here,
                fantastic! We’re excited to already call you a Mainer. In either
                scenario, we’d love to connect you with an Ambassador and
                demonstrate what Maine is all about.

            <p>
                The Maine Ambassador Program is simple. It is an application
                that connects two people; one interested in learning more about
                Maine and one interested in sharing information about Maine.
                Maine Ambassadors are simply Mainers who have signed up to welcome
                people to our State and guests are individuals who have decided
                they’d like to meet a local.

            <p>
                The program was built by the young people of
                <a target="_blank" href="http://propelportland.org">PROPEL</a>.
                Led by Chris Lee and Eric Collins on the business side and Ethan
                Standel and Sean Campbell as the software engineers, they turned
                a vision of statewide ambassador program benefiting all Maine
                communities into a reality. Today the Maine Ambassador Program
                is a fully automated web application that connects people in
                Maine’s predominate tourist and population centers. The program
                acts as the boots on the ground for Maine’s efforts to help people
                make living and working in Maine a reality.
